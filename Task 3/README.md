## Task 3
- Assuming you are working on the backend of a laundry company mobile app, users can select the number of times they
want the laundry company to pick up their clothes in a month, create an API that:
	* Accept pickup day (Monday - Saturday)
	* Accept service recurrence (4 times, 2 times or once a month)
	* Using today (current day) as the start date, generate the next pickup dates for the subscription
	* Return the generated pickup dates as an array

### Approach
- This task was accomplished using ExpessJs 
- Packages used are:
	* moment- A JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
	* dotenv - To load environment variables from .env file
	* nodemon - used as a dev dependency for restarting the server after every changes to code during development
